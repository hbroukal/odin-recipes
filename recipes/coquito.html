    <h1>Coquito</h1>
    <p>Coquito is a creamy, tropical, Puerto Rican holiday drink with tons of coconut flavor.<br>
        It's made with both evaporated and condensed milk, cream of coconut, spices,<br>
        rum, and — in this version — egg yolks.<br>
        It is always requested at my holiday gatherings.<br>
        Sometimes I hide it in the fridge to keep for myself!<br>
        Serve in glass cups and sprinkle with more cinnamon if desired. Feliz Navidad!</p>

    <h2>What is Coquito?</h2>
    <p>Coquito is a traditional holiday drink that originated in Puerto Rico.<br>
        In Spanish, coquito means "little coconut." The beverage is coconut-based and spiked with rum.<br>
        Rich and creamy coquito, which is often thickened with egg yolks, is similar to eggnog.<br>
        In fact, sometimes it's referred to as "Puerto Rican eggnog."</p>

    <h2>Coquito Ingredients</h2>
    <p>These are the ingredients you'll need to make a decadent batch of coquito:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Evaporated milk</strong>: This coquito recipe starts with a can of evaporated milk.</li><br>
        <li><strong>Eggs</strong>: Two beaten egg yolks contribute to the rich, thick, and creamy texture.</li><br>
        <li><strong>Cream of coconut</strong>: Canned cream of coconut lends richness and gives the<br>coquito its signature coconut flavor.</li><br>
        <li><strong>Sweetened condensed milk</strong>: Sweetened condensed milk makes everything<br> more delicious, including this coquito recipe!</li><br>
        <li><strong>White rum</strong>: The best rum for coquito is white Puerto Rican rum, such as <br>Bacardi. In a pinch, any pleasant-tasting white rum will do.</li><br>
        <li><strong>Water</strong>: Water thins the thick and creamy mixture, making it super pourable.</li><br>
        <li><strong>Vanilla</strong>: A teaspoon of vanilla extract takes the flavor up a notch.</li><br>
        <li><strong>Spices</strong>: Cinnamon and cloves add warmth and coziness.</li><br>
    </ul>

        <li>Transfer mixture to a blender. Add cream of coconut, sweetened condensed milk,<br>

        <li>Pour into sterilized glass bottles and store in the refrigerator;
            <br>serve cold or over ice, if desired.</li>
    </ol>
