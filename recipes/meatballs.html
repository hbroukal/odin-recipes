    <h1>Swedish Meatballs</h1>
    <img alt="Swedish meatballs" src="https://www.allrecipes.com/thmb/lYWnWn-oP3dW1toplbQJ49U1ZpA=/750x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/216564-swedish-meatballs-svenska-kottbullar-DDMFS-4x3-2cfaeac162c9485dbd7d632fd0b6ef0a.jpg">
    <p>This Swedish meatball recipe is our family's Christmas tradition.<br>
    We frequently double the recipe and keep it warm in a slow cooker.<br>
    Worth the effort, and the meatballs are even better the next day!<br>
    Reserve brown gravy and add sour cream to it the day you serve the leftovers.</p>
    <br>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 slices day-old white bread, crumbled</li><br>
        <li>½ cup heavy cream</li><br>
        <li>1 teaspoon butter</li><br>
        <li>1 small onion, minced</li><br>
        <li>⅔ pound ground beef</li><br>
        <li>⅓ pound finely ground pork</li><br>
        <li>1 egg</li><br>
        <li>1 tablespoon brown sugar (Optional)</li><br>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li><br>
        <li>¼ teaspoon ground black pepper</li><br>
        <li>¼ teaspoon ground nutmeg</li><br>
        <li>¼ teaspoon ground allspice</li><br>
        <li>⅛ teaspoon ground ginger (Optional)</li><br>
        <li>1 tablespoon butter</li><br>
        <li>¼ cup chicken broth</li><br>
        <li>3 tablespoons all-purpose flour, or as needed</li><br>
        <li>2 cups beef broth, or as needed</li><br>
        <li>½ (8 ounce) container sour cream</li><br>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li><br>
        <li>Place bread crumbs into a small bowl; mix in cream. <br>
            Allow to stand until crumbs absorb cream, about 10 minutes.</li><br>
        <li>Meanwhile, melt 1 teaspoon butter in a skillet over medium heat;<br>
            cook and stir onion until light brown, about 10 minutes.<br>
            Transfer onion to a mixing bowl.</li><br>
        <li>Mix ground beef, ground pork, egg, brown sugar, salt,<br>
            black pepper, nutmeg, allspice, and ginger with onion in the mixing bowl.<br>
            Lightly mix in bread crumbs and cream.</li><br>
        <li>Melt 1 tablespoon butter in a large skillet over medium heat.<br>
            Pinch off about 1 1/2 tablespoon meat mixture per meatball; form into balls.<br>
            Place meatballs into the skillet and cook, turning often, until browned, about 5 minutes.<br>
            Insides of meatballs will still be pink.</li><br>
        <li>Place browned meatballs into a baking dish,<br>
            pour in chicken broth, and cover with foil.</li><br>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until meatballs are tender,<br>
            about 40 minutes. Remove meatballs to a serving dish.</li><br>
        <li>Pour pan drippings into a saucepan over medium heat.<br>
            Whisk flour into drippings until smooth.</li><br>
        <li>Gradually whisk in enough beef broth to total about 2 1/2 cups liquid.</li><br>
        <li>Bring gravy to a simmer, whisking constantly, until thickened, about 5 minutes.</li><br>
        <li>Just before serving, whisk in sour cream. Season with salt and black pepper.<br> 
            Serve gravy with meatballs.</li>
    </ol>
